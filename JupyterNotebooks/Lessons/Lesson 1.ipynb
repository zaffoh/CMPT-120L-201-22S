    "- Welcome to CMPT 120\n",
    "- What is Computer Science\n",

    "### Welcome to CMPT 120!\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course I'll be teaching you introductory and eventually some upper level and more advanced topics related to computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this course lesson notes will primarily be hosted using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/index.html). I don't expect you as intro students to be proficent with them but I do want you to become familiar with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "With Jupyter Notebooks we can:\n",
    "- Have notes for each lesson. \n",
    "- Have a place where we can see how code executes.\n",
    "- Have an interactive space for students to be able to rerun things seen in lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware vs Software\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the world of computing we have 2ish realms. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Hardware\n",
    "- Software\n",
    "- Firmware (ish)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the most basic sense, we have hardware which is our physical. This is made up of servers, storage, memory, mainfraimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside of those things we also have physical components that go into it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we have software which is code. This is where we do things like programming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, hacking, cybersecurity, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Languages\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "We have several languages that we can use. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have:\n",
    "- Python (Web Based Applications/Scripting language/Object Oriented Language)\n",
    "- Javascript (Web Based Applications)\n",
    "- Java (Object Oriented Language)\n",
    "- C (Object Oriented Language)\n",
    "- C++ (Game Development/Object Oriented)\n",
    "- C# (Object Oriented Language)\n",
    "- Scala (Functional Language)\n",
    "- Objective C (Object Oriented Language)\n",
    "- Assembler (Low Level Language)\n",
    "- Ruby (Web Based Application/Scripting Language)\n",
    "- So on and so forth...\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages have different uses for different things. Some are used for websites, some are great at making video games, some work well with banks and protecting valuable information. \n",
    "\n",
    "People typicallly pick up different languages depending on the things that they choose to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have:\n",
    "- Scripting Languages\n",
    "- Object Oriented Languages\n",
    "- Functional Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Each one of them has strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Computer Science is Relevant\n",
    "Computer science is everywhere in the form of websites, apps, calculators, data science, quantum computing, cloud, video games, art, sciences, geological studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many fields that are benifiting from the aid of CS. It's becoming more and more prevelant as time goes on. It's become a consumable way for people to transform and modernize their mediums for a more modern audience. \n",
    "\n",
    "The potiential of all the the possible parings are unimaginable. Our roles are to bridge those gaps and make things more attainable for those that come next. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Counting in Decimal vs Binary vs Hexidecimal\n",
    "So to think how computers think we need to understand the way they process things. To do that we need to understand the math behind some of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "10 digits exist in decimal, otherwise known as base 10.\n",
    "```\n",
    "[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the ones place we can count to 9. Once we get there and add one we need to then add another place (the tens place) cause we're out of digits. Causing us to get 10. The same idea happens when we move into counting with a different base. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the numbers above are the actual and the numbers below are how we count in decimal\n",
    "```\n",
    "00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n",
    "\n",
    "00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2 digits exist in binary, otherwise known as base 2.\n",
    "```\n",
    "[0 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So the numbers above are the actual and the numbers below are how we count in binary\n",
    "```\n",
    "0000 0001 0002 0003 0004 0005 0006 0007 0008 0009 0010 0011 0012 0013 0014 0015 00016\n",
    "\n",
    "0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000 1001 1010 1011 1100 1101 1110 1111 10000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in Hexidecimal we go the other way and have more \"numbers\". 16 digits exist in hex, otherwise known as base 16\n",
    "```\n",
    "[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F]\n",
    "```\n",
    "So the numbers above are the actual and the numbers below are how we count in binary\n",
    "```\n",
    "00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15\n",
    "\n",
    "00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers think with bits and bytes and those are represented in Binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "byte is 8 bits\n",
    "bits can either be 0 or 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "[0000 0100]\n",
    "\n",
    "Being that this is all that computers understand at a base level there's a vast amount of knowledge in between that and our programming language.\n",

    "### Identifiers and Expressions\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "So in programming we have Identifiers and Expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifiers are fairly simple they're the names that we have for things and that we give to things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions on the other hand are a little more complex they resemble something that we want our identifiers to equate to. We'll start to get into this and much more next class. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Style\n",
    "---\n",
    "Style is important, style can make our lives as programmers easier. Help us to keep our code readable. As well as help others maintain our code once we move on. Here are a few examples of where this can come in in terms of writing variables and filenames.\n",
