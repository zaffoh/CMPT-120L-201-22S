The only one that's different is to create a file. So we need to be comfortable navigating our file systems. This becomes relevant as we start to develop more pure scripts we have to move away from our GUIs.\n",

Below we have a couple paths and what you need to understand is that `/` and `\\` denotes that you're going down a level in the folder or that you're going inside of that folder.\n",
