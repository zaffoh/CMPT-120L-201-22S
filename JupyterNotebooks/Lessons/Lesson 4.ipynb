    "## Importance of Design\n",
    "---\n",
    "So this is a topic that i didn't learn the importance of until I was in the work force. Design is a major influence in the way that code is build and in a major capacity and significant effect on the industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pretend we have a client that wants us to do the following:\n",
    "- Write a function which will count the number of times any one character appears in a string of characters. \n",
    "- Write a main function which takes the character to be counted from the user and calls the function, outputting the result to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, are you like Android and take the latest and greatest and put them into phones in an unregulated hardware market. Thus leaving great variability in the market for your brand? Are you an Apple where you control the full stack. Your hardware and software may not be bleeding edge but it's seamless and uniform.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the market want? What are you good at? Do you have people around you that can fill your gaps?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a blurb from a friend about the matter:\n",
    ">Design, often paired with the phrase \"design thinking\", is an approach and method of problem solving that builds empathy for user(s) of a product, resulting in the creation of a seamless and delightful user experience tailored to the user's needs.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Design thinks holistically about the experience that a user would go through when encountering and interacting with a product or technology. Design understands the user and their needs in great detail so that the product team can build the product and experience that fits what the user is looking for. We don't want to create products for the sake of creating them, we want to ensure that there is a need for it by a user.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Design not only focuses on the actual interface design of a product, but can also ensure the actual technology has a seamless experience as well. Anything that blocks potential users from wanting to buy a product or prohibits current users from utilizing the product successfully, design wants to investigate. We ensure all pieces fit together from the user's standpoint, and we work to build a bridge between the technology and the user, who doesn't need to understand the technical depths of the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sorting Example [(Toptal Sorting Algorithms)](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms)\n",
    "---\n",
    "Hypothetical, a client comes to you and they want you sort a list of numbers how do you optimally sort a list? `[2, 5, 6, 1, 4, 3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Thinking [(IBM Design Thinking)](https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/)\n",
    "---\n",
    "As this idea starts to grow you come to realize that different companies have different design methodologies. IBM has it's own version of Design Thinking. You can find more information about that at the site linked in the title. IBM is very focused on being exactly like its customers in most aspects. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we're mostly going to take from this is that there are entire careers birthed from thinking before you act. That being said we're going to harp on a couple parts of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Knowing what your requirements are\n",
    "---\n",
    "One of the most common scenarios to come across is a product that is annouced that's going to change everything. In the planning phase everyone agrees that the idea is amazing and going to solve all of our problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "We get down the line and things start to fall apart, we run out of time. Things ran late, or didn't come in in time pushing everything out. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scope creep ensued.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is typically the result of not agreeing on what our requirements are. Something as basic as agreeing on what needs to be done needs to be discussed and checked on thouroughly. We do this because often two people rarely are thinking exactly the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to be on the same page as your client and your fellow developers as well. If you don't know ask. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Planning Things Out\n",
    "---\n",
    "We have an idea on what we want to do. So now we just write it? No, not quite. We need to have a rough plan on how we're going to do things. Do we want to use functions, do we need a quick solution, is this going to be verbose and complex? \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to look at what we can set up for ourselves. We don't need to make things difficult by planning things out poorly. This means allotting time for things like getting stuck and brainstorming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breaking things down\n",
    "---\n",
    "Personally I like to take my problem and scale it down into an easy example so in the case of our problem. The client may want to process a text like Moby Dick. We can start with a sentence and work our way up!\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the time to break things in to multiple pieces and figure out what goes where is an art in itself.\n"
