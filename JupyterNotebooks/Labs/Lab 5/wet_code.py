# We're looking to find out how much money we have after a day with friends on Saturday. 
# Our code does the trick but we learned about keeping out code DRY recently and want to make it more efficent by making it DRY.
# I want you to accomplish this by making functions where you see repeated code. 
# Some things to note. When we have a positive number that gets split up and 85% goes into checking and 15% goes into savings. 
# All negative numbers gets taken out of the checking account.
